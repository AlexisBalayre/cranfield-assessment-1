# Linear Regression With Descent Gradient (Advanced Python and Advanced Java Assessment)

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a program to perform linear regression using descent gradient.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`.
4. Install the required dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Use the jupiter notebook `assessment_advertising-dataset.ipynb` to run the program on the advertising dataset.
6. Use the jupiter notebook `assessment_auto-dataset.ipynb` to run the program on the auto dataset.
